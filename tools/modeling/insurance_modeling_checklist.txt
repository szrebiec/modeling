Steps in modeling: 
	Data assembly and QA
		Time cost
			Exposure, Loss and premium
			Attributes:
		control totals: (total loss, exposure, record) 
			monitor on raw
			track accross data
			Waterfalls and filters
	eda 
		Time cost
		summary statistics and hit rates
		evaluation of data across segments
		comparisons in distributions on segments
	sample
		Time cost
		train/test/hold out
		Coarse sampling
		stratified sampling 
	feature_engineering   
		Time cost: 
		binning
		imputation
    univariate analyisis                                                                                
		charts pivot tables
		graphs
	modeling
		Time cost: 
		variable selection
		multicolinearity
			VIFs
			correlation matrices
		Build a model 
		Model logging
		metrics: 
			[gini] (SZ)
				gini_1 / gini_2 = 1.1 = very large improvement
				15%-60% depending
			[total Deviance]
				Need to do it - (Shawn)
			[ASE Average Square Error for lift chart]
				score_len < 1000 pre_bin, otherwise just mse
			Generic method
				establish baselines using LO 
				OR establish baselines using Random noise for evaluation
				OR drop top variable
		Types of binning: 
		exhibits 
			Time cost: 
			[Lift Charts]
            Lorenz curves
			Performance on segments

Next Steps: Evaluation metrics: 
	Binning 
		fixed width, n 
		fixed quantiles, 
		passed values
	Lift Chart  
	Lorenz curve (check)
	MAE (check)
	MSE (check)
	gini (chekc)
